\title{tsibble: tidy temporal data frames and tools}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: align='right'}}
The \strong{tsibble} package provides a data class of \code{tbl_ts} to represent tidy
temporal data. A tsibble consists of a time index, key, and other measured
variables in a data-centric format, which is built on top of the tibble.
}
\section{Index}{

The time indices are preserved as the essential data component of the tsibble,
instead of implicit attribute (for example, the \code{tsp} attribute in a \code{ts} object). A
few index classes, such as \code{Date}, \code{POSIXct}, and \code{difftime}, forms the basis of
the tsibble, with new additions \link{yearweek}, \link{yearmonth}, and \link{yearquarter}
representing year-week, year-month, and year-quarter respectively. Any arbitrary
index class are also supported, including \code{zoo::yearmon}, \code{zoo::yearqtr}, and
\code{nanotime}.
For a \code{tbl_ts} of regular interval,
a choice of index representation has to be made. For example, a monthly data
should correspond to time index created by \link{yearmonth} or \code{zoo::yearmon},
instead of \code{Date} or \code{POSIXct}. Because months in a year ensures the regularity,
12 months every year. However, if using \code{Date}, a month contains days ranging
from 28 to 31 days, which results in irregular time space. This is also applicable
to year-week and year-quarter.

Since the \strong{tibble} that underlies the \strong{tsibble} only accepts a 1d atomic
vector or a list, a \code{tbl_ts} doesn't accept \code{POSIXlt} and \code{timeDate} columns.
}

\section{Key}{

Key variable(s) together with the index uniquely identifies each record, which
can be created via the \link{id} function as identifiers:
\itemize{
\item Empty: an implicit variable \code{id()} resulting in a univariate time series.
\item One or more variables: explicit variables. For example, \code{data(pedestrian)}
and \code{data(tourism)} use the \code{id(Sensor)} & \code{id(Region, State, Purpose)} as
the key respectively.
}
}

\section{Interval}{

The \link{interval} function returns the interval associated with the tsibble.
\itemize{
\item Regular: the value and its time unit including "nanosecond", "microsecond",
"millisecond", "second", "minute", "hour", "day", "week", "month", "quarter",
"year". An unrecognisable time interval is labelled as "unit".
\item Irregular: \code{as_tsibble(regular = FALSE)} gives the irregular tsibble. It is
marked with \code{!}.
\item Unknown: if there is only one entry for each key variable, the interval
cannot be determined (\code{?}).
}

An interval is obtained based on the corresponding index representation:
\itemize{
\item integer/numeric: either "unit" or "year"
\item \code{yearquarter}/\code{yearqtr}: "quarter"
\item \code{yearmonth}/\code{yearmon}: "month"
\item \code{yearweek}: "week"
\item \code{Date}: "day"
\item \code{POSIXct}: "hour", "minute", "second", "millisecond", "microsecond"
\item \code{nanotime}: "nanosecond"
}
}

\section{Time zone}{

Time zone corresponding to index will be displayed if index is \code{POSIXct}.
\code{?} means that the obtained time zone is a zero-length character "".
}

\section{Print options}{

The tsibble package fully utilises the \code{print} method from the tibble. Please
refer to \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble::tibble-package} to change display options.

# create a tsibble w/o a key ----
tsibble(
  date = as.Date("2017-01-01") + 0:9,
  value = rnorm(10)
)

# create a tsibble with one key ----
tsibble(
  qtr = rep(yearquarter("2010-01") + 0:9, 3),
  group = rep(c("x", "y", "z"), each = 10),
